## Development Environment Configuration
- Download the files from this repository.

  ```bash
  git clone

  ```

- Now, let's activate the created virtual environment

  ```bash
  conda activate jokbot
  ```

- With the virtual environment activated we are going to install 
  the requirements used in the project

  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- We must export the following environment variable

  ```bash
  export $(cat .env | grep -v ^# | xargs)
  ```

- Finally, run the application server

  ```bash
  python -m flask run
  ```
